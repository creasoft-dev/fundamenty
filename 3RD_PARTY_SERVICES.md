Third Party Services
====================

The starter uses two 3rd party services: 
1. Google Analytics, to keep track of the page visit statistics
2. Algolia Search, to provide search capability

This page will explain how to create account on each service and integrate with the site.

Algolia provides a free-tier account allowing you to index up to 10K index entries without cost.

### Creating Account

    - Even if it says "free trial" as long as your index size stays under 10k, you will not be 
    chared.
2. Since you already created a Google Account you can select Google as the sign up mechanism. 
Fill in the form and press **Next**.

Now you have an account. The next step is to create an index.

### Creating an Index
1. Go to Dashboard and accept the terms and conditions.
2. Sine it's your first time, you will see a **Create Index** button, click it.
3. In the "Create index" form, enter the name of your index, something like prod_{your_website}_website 

That's the value you will use for ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME env variable.

Now you have an index, the next step is to obtain the different keys

Go to the left menu and scroll down until you see **API keys**, click it.

### Configuring local env and GitLab CI/CD variable

In the root directory create a `.env` file and plug in the values for:
```
ALGOLIA_APP_ID=
ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=
ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API_KEY=
ALGOLIA_ADMIN_API_kEY=
```
And save the `.env` file. This will enable search in the local run.
We don't want to check the `.env` file, it is already included in `.gitignore`. 

Go to GitLab CI/CD and create variables for all the values obtained above
