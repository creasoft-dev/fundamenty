## Prerequisites
Minimal prerequisite is [node](https://nodejs.org/). Although latest version of node comes with
npm package manager, in this project I am using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

## Installation
Just clone or download the project, and rename it accordingly
Then install dependencies:
```
$ yarn install
# or
$ npm install
```

## Serving the Site Locally
To build and serve locally for development
```
$ yarn serve
```
If you are using `npm` you can replace `yarn build` with `npm run build`, etc.

## Configuring CI/CD
This project scripts to deploy automatically on GitHub Pages and GitLab Pages. GitHub uses `.github\workflows\deploy-gh-pages.yml`, and GitLab uses `.gitlab-ci.yml` respectively.

But you can also deploy on other SSG hosting providers such Netlify, [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/)

You may provide the following environment variables for the deployment.

The `WEB_PATH_PREFIX` variable is for the prefix path, which is required if your site lives in a different subdirectory. Needed for GitLab/GitHub Pages.
The rest of the variables are optional. If not provided, the feature will just be disabled.

- `WEB_ROOT_URL`           - Website's root URL, used to generate site.xml
- `WEB_PATH_PREFIX`        - The URL context path. Needed when site lives in non-root path.
- `GOOGLE_TAG_ID`          - Google Analytics tag ID (it starts with `UA-`)
- `ALGOLIA_APP_ID`         - Algolia's APP ID
- `ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME`     - Algolia's Index name
- `ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API_KEY` - Algolia's Search only API Key
- `ALGOLIA_ADMIN_API_kEY`  - Algolia's Admin API Key (for pushing posts to Algolia index)
- `DISQUS_SITE_NAME`       - Disqus' site name, for commenting.


For creating accounts in Google Analytics and Algolia, see the [3RD_PARTY_SERVICES.md](3RD_PARTY_SERVICES.md)

## Customizing the Site and Working with Content
Now that you have installed and served the starter project, you can configure the site by
modifying the `./.fundamenty.yml` file with appropriate values, and then running
```shell
$ yarn fundamenty:tool init
```
This will generate two files `./src/_data/site.json.gen` and `./.env.gen`. You can rename those
files by removing the `.gen` extension. You may need to delete the original `./src/_data/site.json` file.


Then create site pages under `./src/{lang}/pages`, and articles/posts under `./src/{lang}/posts`.
Those two location includes [directory data files](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-template-dir/) with contextual data fields `locale` and `tags`.

The top menu can be customized by modifying the file in `./src/_data/l10n/menu_{lang}.json`.

When you have links to local asset use the `url` filter, e.g. `{{ yourUrl | url }}`

### Localization
The directory with the name of locales under `./src`, e.g. `en` and `es` defines the locale of the
content under that directory. This is done through  the  directory data file.

The localization of the navigation and translation were externalized in `./src/_data/l10n` directory.

The list of active locales are defined in `./src/_data/site.js` data file.
Based on the list of languages, the Eleventy configuration file - `/.eleventy.js` generates
post collections per each locale, which can be accessed by the name:
`collections.posts_{lang}`.


### Site Content Directory Structure
The site content is under `./src`.
```
├───{lang}       - Contents in given locale
│   ├ {lang}.json    - Common front matter for all the contents in Spanish
│   ├───pages    - Site pages
│   └───posts    - Site posts (e.g. blog articles)
├───images       - Images
├───scripts      -
│   ├ main.js    - Main JS file webapack uses to build the asset bundle.
│   └ algolia.js - Site posts (blog articles)
├───styles       - Tailwind's CSS styling
├───_data        - Data/configuration file.
│   ├ site.js    - Main site configuration data.
│   ├───l10n     - localization resource bundles
└───_includes    - Eleventy's inclusion files, as specified in the front matter
    └───layouts  - Layouts
```

## Creating a Content
You can use fundamenty-cli tool to create scaffolding files.
To create a post:
```
$ yarn fun-cli post/item "My Post Title" -l en
```
Will generate under `/src/en/posts/yyyy-mm-dd-my-post-title.md` file. Then just populate the front matter and the body with Markdown.

## Next Steps
Fore more advanced Eleventy, read the [its documentation](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/).

Especially the [documentation on page data](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-eleventy-supplied/) is useful.
